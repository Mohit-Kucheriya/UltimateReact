# Ultimate React — Learning & Projects Repository

This repository documents my React learning journey from fundamentals to building full-stack applications using modern React and Next.js.

The goal of this repository is to progressively build strong React foundations, apply concepts in real projects, and understand real-world frontend and full-stack workflows.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into parts, each representing a stage of learning.

### Part-1_React-Fundamentals
